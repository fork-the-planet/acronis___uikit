Fix `SidebarPrimaryMenuItem` / `SidebarSecondaryMenuItem` trailing-extras layout: tags, shortcuts, and external-link icons passed as children are now split from the label and pinned to the right edge of the row (`shrink-0`), while the title takes the remaining width and truncates with an ellipsis (`min-w-0`). Previously the extras flowed inline after the label, so a long title pushed them off the row instead of truncating.
